/*
   This is example code on how to use Maker LED Matrix Dispaly library on e-radionica Maker LED Matrix Display Board with ESP8266 and two IL31LF3731.
   It shows how to print text/message to display, write picture, scroll it, pause it and remove it.
   
   !!!!NOTE!!!!
   In order to use this library, you have to have at least ESP8266 Core version 2.5.0.
   If You have 2.4.2 and older, you must update ESP8266 Core.
   It will not work on 2.4.2. and older!

/*For converting greyscale image, use LCD Image Converter.
 * Open program->New Image->Type Image Name and click ok->Image->Import
 * Then select image that you want to convert (note that image should not be bigger than dispaly. If it is, use Paint to resize it.
 * Options->Conversion
 * Preset should be on Grayscale 8, Type Grayscale, Inverse selected, main scan direction Top to bottom
 * Line scan direction Forward. Than click on Image, block size should be 8 bit and byte order to little endian.
 * By clicking Show Preview, you should see image as well as data array. Colors on image should be inversed.
 * Click ok, save it, then File->Convert and save your data array. Open it and copy here.
